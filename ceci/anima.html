        <p class="padding-normal">
          anima began as an exploration to find a meeting point between ancestry, craftsmanship, and type design.
          The sketching process for anima was long and complex, involving shape research with different tools and from different perspectives
          drawing inspiration from patterns and textures found in Prehispanic carvings and crafts.
          <br><br>
          The idea of “more is more” was always obsessively present at each stage of the process, questioning how much is the right amount of “more” and
          when it becomes just “unnecessary drama”.
  <br><br>
          I’ve always been drawn to the subject of ornamentation, patterns and textures, an influence I attribute to my cultural background.
          Where I come from, there’s nothing simple or minimalist. It’s actually completely the opposite and there’s something about that complexity
          and sense of “muchness” that has always spoken to me. This was something I wanted to imprint on my project.
  <br><br>
          Much of my experimentation revolved around those ideas: patterns, texture itself, and texture in text.
          I wondered in what ways I could play with the parameters of letterforms to control those textures.
          At what point do letters become an image? How do you sketch in a way that actually tests a coherent type system?
          These questions and the entire exploration became a reflection on the true purpose of a sketch within the design process.

            During this phase, while generating all these sketches, I naively believed I was making progress and that eventually, in a sudden Eureka moment,
            I would land on the right idea.The truth is, I wasn’t really moving forward. I was stuck in the same place, just producing ideas.
            They might have been viable paths, but nothing was concrete yet. And no matter how good an idea is, it means nothing if it doesn’t evolve.
            Then one day, Peter Verheul, in all his wisdom, told me: “Ceci, instead of growing branches from a single tree, you’re creating an entire forest.”
            That moment was incredibly frustrating. But looking back, I’m grateful for it. It taught me the difference between sketching as experimentation
            and sketching with specific intention during the process, how to develop a single idea, and when it’s time to move on.
            <br><br>
It also made me realize the infinite possibilities that exist within this discipline. Letters are raw material ready to be shaped. They can be molded to fit any idea or concept.But that doesn’t mean you have to create them all … or do you? ;)

    <!-- process -->
    <section>
      <div class="padding-page text">
        <h1 class="padding-normal">Process</h1>
        <p class="padding-normal">
          The turning point for anima came at a later stage in the process, when I decided which path to take and found a way to add the “right” amount of
          certain ingredients to the recipe, integrating the knowledge I had gained during the first semester while developing my revival project based on
          the Enschedé Foundry and Fleischman’s Baroque typefaces.
<br><br>
          When I first discovered Fleischmann’s work, I was very intrigued, and I became kind of obsessed with it. There was something fascinating about
          the uniqueness of his shapes, the texture of his text typefaces, the unexpected contrast, the optical sizes, the distinctive features, and
          the ornamentality.
          It was during that research that I learned more about Baroque typefaces, and of course, their expressive, and decorative aesthetic completely
          resonated with me, specially after all the sketches I had already developed.
          So, in an experimental way, I aimed to bring some of that Fleischmann baroqueness into the present, filtered through my own project and
          perspective.
<br><br>
          The foundation of anima became a blend of an exploration of Fleischmann’s proportions and ornamental features across his optical sizes,
          combined with personal brush calligraphy explorations inspired by modern interpretations of pre-Hispanic carvings found in Mexico.
          It’s the Baroque style that builds the bridge between them. Baroque in Mexico, a style from the 17th and 18th centuries, merges European
          elements with indigenous traditions, creating a unique version of Baroque that incorporates pre-Hispanic elements and local craftsmanship.

            anima currently has a width and weight axis in display sizes, both roman and italic, and an ornamental display version where the full
            drama of ball terminals reaches its peak expression.
            Was this ornamental style completely unnecessary? … Absolutely, but it was also a lot of fun :)
            In Latin, “anima” means “soul” or “spirit.” and related to psychology “anima” refers to the unconscious feminine aspect of a man.

          In Erik van Blokland words, “anima is a line between two points far removed by time and space.The attempt to interpret Mexican cultural and artisanal references through the lens of an 18th-century German punchcutter living in Amsterdam might seem unlikely, but along this process it became a natural, unquestionable perspective.”
<br><br>
          For me, in the context of my personal search for meaning in my own work and this project, Fleischmann’s work became the perfect example of
          “more is more”&nbsp;—&thinsp;but in just the right amount.
          I like to believe that, with the right balance of certain elements and a clear sense of when more is truly more, there’s a point where these distant worlds meet and that’s where anima exists.
